        <h2>About Me 🙋‍♂️</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce in Accounting at the University of Dar es Salaam. My passion for technology began back in my ordinary level of secondary school, where I studied computer studies and was introduced to website development. Since then, I’ve been deeply interested in web and software development, and later on blockchain, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications since my academic focus is on accounting and finance, I'm always eager to explore how technology can innovate financial systems and create new opportunities.</p>
